# CSS Structure Utilized by Kava Docs Themes

## Customizing CSS

Kava Docs Themes provide default CSS settings that are apply to the site's appearance. However, it is possible to create new CSS rules (and override existing ones) by specifying a custom CSS file that gets applied **after** the standard CSS settings get applied. Therefore, the custom CSS settings "win out" over the ones provided out of the box.

For more information on how to specify a custom CSS file, see [Table of Contents File Structure](TOC File Structure)

## Default CSS File

The current CSS file used by the Kava Docs Default Theme contains the following styles:

```css
<kava-topic link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DocHound/DocHoundEngine/master/DocHound/wwwroot/Themes/Default/Theme.css" />
```
