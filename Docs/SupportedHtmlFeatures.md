# Supported HTML Features

Kava Docs supports HTML as a topic type. This feature is currently very simple in that it brings in the HTML document "as is" and displays it in the main content area of the page. No further processing is done on the HTML page at this point.

> Note: This feature is on our list for future improvements. We are planning to provide features such as fixing image links in the HTML document, removing header and meta tags, removing scrips, and so on. This will improve security. Therefore, be aware that you should not be using such HTML features, since they will stop working at some point.
