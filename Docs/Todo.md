This is a list of todo items:


* [X] Make the current tab work on mobile (responsive)
* [X] Make the main menu configurable
* Functional issues:
    * [ ] Make sure that all the data in the topic is data-driven (from the repository)
    * [ ] Document title is still hardcoded
* [ ] Dark/light/sepia theme
* [ ] Allow for different templates (or CSS styles) for different topics or topic trees. For instance, I would like to show the CODE Ohana booklet topics with a different page template (sepia Hawaiian theme) from other topics
* [ ] Maybe listing contributors to a topic or all the docs (optional)
    * [ ] Maybe we could also show last-edited
    * [ ] Microsoft shows “estimated time to read” at the top of topics
* [ ] Sharing of documents would be nice
* [ ] Multiple standard themes
* [ ] Showing the outline with indent levels
* Styling
    * [ ] H3 needs to get their own style
    * [ ] Need good default styles for tables
* [ ] Need to be able to refer to other TOC files as a single node from within a TOC file
* [ ] Need to get the search implemented
* [ ] Edit link right in the topic
* [ ] Support copy & Paste of code snippets (have an icon in the header that people can click on to copy)
* [ ] Threaded discussions, or at least comments
* [ ] PDF export
* [ ] Markdown improvements
    * [ ] Support FontAwesome
	* [ ] Take a look at all the standard (optional) Markdig features to see what should be supported in ours (probably a lot)
