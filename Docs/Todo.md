This is a list of todo items:


* [X] Make the current tab work on mobile (responsive)
* [X] Make the main menu configurable
* [ ] Functional issues:
    * [ ] Make sure that all the data in the topic is data-driven (from the repository)
    * [x] The tree should invisibly contain keywords so a tree filter will also include keywords
    * [ ] It would be nice to be able to get away with just once instance of the tree in the document
    * [x] Document title is still hardcoded
    * [x] Handle image paths relative to documents stored in root folders properly

* [ ] Allow for a configurable page icon
* [ ] Themes
	* [ ] Dark theme
	* [ ] Sepia theme
* [ ] Allow for different templates (or CSS styles) for different topics or topic trees. For instance, I would like to show the CODE Ohana booklet topics with a different page template (sepia Hawaiian theme) from other topics
* [ ] Maybe listing contributors to a topic or all the docs (optional)
    * [ ] Maybe we could also show last-edited
    * [ ] Microsoft shows “estimated time to read” at the top of topics

* [x] Showing the outline with indent levels

    * [x] H3 needs to get their own style
    * [x] Need good default styles for tables
    * [x] Need good default style for blockquotes
* [ ] Need to be able to refer to other TOC files as a single node from within a TOC file
* [ ] Need to get the search implemented
   * [x] Need the basic ability to filter the tree
   * [ ] Need the more advanced ability to do a full search across all documents using Azure Search

* [ ] Support copy & Paste of code snippets (have an icon in the header that people can click on to copy)
* [ ] Threaded discussions, or at least comments
* [ ] PDF export
* [ ] Markdown improvements
    * [ ] Support FontAwesome
    * [ ] Take a look at all the standard (optional) Markdig features to see what should be supported in ours (probably a lot)
